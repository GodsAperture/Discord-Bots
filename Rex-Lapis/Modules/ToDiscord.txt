Discord, if you're reading this. I hate that I always lose context between interactions.
No, I don't want to make a Dictionary to store shit in, because that's annoying.
I want to be able to receive multiple interactions simultaneously and handle it with a single
interaction handler isntead of having 10+ interaction handlers.

It is extremely annoying dealing with Discord as it stands.
I love your platform but I absolutely hate developing my bot on it.
Please, for the love of God, fix this shit. Support better Modals:

Also please let users send and receive classes whose members are relevant information.
This would make information retention much easier.
